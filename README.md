# **🌟Welcome to My GitHub World!🌟**

Hey there, curious traveler! 👋

Embark on an exciting journey with me as I navigate the thrilling waters of data analytics, armed with an MBA in Finance and a passion for untangling numbers, trends, and insights. What started as a fascination for Coding (yes, I voluntarily love SQL) has now evolved into a full-blown mission to turn raw data into impactful stories.

Here’s what you’ll find on this treasure map:

💻 Projects that showcase my evolution from finance geek to data analytics pro.

🎯 Skills honed through sleepless nights with Python, SQL, Power BI, and enough DAX to rival Shakespeare (okay, maybe not).

🌟 A whole lot of enthusiasm for learning, growing, and solving complex problems.
